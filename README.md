# WARNING - MEMES

## This stuff is totally random
Basically I discovered that AI is really good at HTML so I randomly have it make me sites and I post most here. 

## Why is it called button.html?
So it doesn't look suspicious in a link.

## Can I steal these files?
Totally. Use them however you'd like, within reason.

## Found this from my WAN IP?
Awesome! If you have a moment to spare, consider opening a discussion about how you found it! I also have NGINX logs if you did :)

Please be respectful of my **40Mbps** cable upload speed hahaha

<summary>Self Hosted Server Info</summary>

The server is a **Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q** running Ubuntu 22.04 and Nginx.

It runs a lot of things, and I thought it would be funny to have a Rickroll server too.
- 20k RPS tested
- 1000+ concurrent connections handled
- NVMe laughed
- WAN is the bottleneck *(please don't send the WAN IP to 500 friends!)*
