# WARNING - MEMES

## This stuff is totally random
Basically I discovered that AI is really good at HTML so I randomly have it make me sites and I post most here. 

## Why is it called button.html?
So it doesn't look suspicious.

## Can I steal these files?
Totally. Use them however you'd like, within reason.

## Found this from my WAN IP?
Awesome! If you have a moment to spare, consider opening a discussion about how you found it! I also have NGINX logs if you did :)
